# miniLinux

miniLinux is a Linux distribution for embedded systems and smart IoT devices. 

miniLinux uses MiniGUI (the MiniGUI core and the components) as the window
system and GUI toolkit.

We intend to provide a Python-based runtime framework and a set of APIs 
for the development of miniLinux apps.

developmenet environment.
